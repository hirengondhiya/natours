# Natours

This repo is built while developing a landing page while following Jonas Schmedtmann's Advanced CSS and SASS course.

## Links

The landing page is hosted on GitHub pages and the URL is https://hirengondhiya.github.io/natours/

## Development workflow

I have used a different devlopment workflow compared to what is used in the course

- Used Parcel bundler for serving the page in local dev environment and to create build.
- Used Prettier, Husky and lint-staged to style all my source files automatically before they're committed.
- Used git's subtree push to commit build files to gh-pages branch and then serve the page from the gh-pages branch.

## Some of the modern CSS Properties used

- **clip-path**: To render the elements in various shapes. For more look for documentation on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path)
